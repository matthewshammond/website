<!-- ![Matt Hammond](/author/matt-hammond.png) -->

I am a prior military professional with military aviation experience and Special Operations experience. As well as civilian aviation experience in helicopters and fixed wing stateside and abroad. I have turned an interest, hobby, and passion of IT related content into a strong knowledge in the areas of cyber network security analysis, DevOps tool administration, and information security system analysis by completing Security+, CEH, and Splunk Core User certifications. I will be using Github and my website to continue my learning and as a place to implement what I learn.

- Services as a contract pilot for fixed wing, rotary wing, and sUAS.
- Install/setup/manage networks for your small/medium business or home.
- Help you design and host your own website and services.
- Provide mentoring and advising for military staff exercises.
